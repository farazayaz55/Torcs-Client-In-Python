Torcs Client for autonomous car In Python

TORCS is an open-source 3D car racing simulator available on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, AmigaOS 4, AROS, MorphOS and Microsoft Windows. TORCS was created by Eric Espi√© and Christophe Guionneau, but project development is now headed by Bernhard Wymann. It is written in C++ and is licensed under the GNU GP</br>

the competition software for the Simulated Car Racing Championship, an
international competition held at major conferences in the field of Evolutionary Computation and
in the field of Computational Intelligence and Games.
The goal of the competition is to design a controller for a racing car that will compete on a set
of unknown tracks first alone (against the clock) and then against other drivers. The controllers
perceive the racing environment through a number of sensors that describe the relevant features
of the car surroundings (e.g., the track limits, the position of near-by obstacles), of the car state
(the fuel level, the engine RPMs, the current gear, etc.), and the current game state (lap time,
number of lap, etc.). The controller can perform the typical driving actions (clutch, changing gear,
accelerate, break, steering the wheel, etc.). A description of the championship, including the rules
and regulations, can be found at http://cig.sourceforge.net/
The championship platform is built on top of The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) a
state-of-the-art open source car racing simulator which provides a full 3D visualization, a sophisticated physics engine, and accurate car dynamics taking into account traction, aerodynamics, fuel
consumption, etc.
